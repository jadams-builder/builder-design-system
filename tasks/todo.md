## Priority Legend
- **High Priority**: Essential for most applications, frequently used
- **Medium Priority**: Common use cases, moderate complexity
- **Low Priority**: Specialized use cases, advanced functionality

## Development Notes
- All components should follow the established patterns in Button, Card, and Input
- Use design tokens from `builderio-design-tokens.css` consistently
- **Use Tabler Icons exclusively** - Import from `@tabler/icons-react` for all iconography
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces extending native HTML elements  
- Include accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Support responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Provide comprehensive prop interfaces with sensible defaults
